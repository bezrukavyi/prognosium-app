    alpha: Alpha is an adaptation parameter. The closer it is to 1, the faster information is updated, that is, the more weight have new observations.
    beta: Beta is an anti-aliasing parameter that regulates the process of trend adaptation.
    fi: Fi - parameter of smoothing, which performs the function of suppressing the trend
    period: The period for which the forecast is carried out
    brown: "The Brown's method reflects development not only in the form of a linear trend, but also in the form of a random process that has no tendency."
    holt: "The main difference between the Holt's method is the consideration of the simulation of the trend of the series."
    mc_kanzey: "Using the Gardner-Mackenzie's method, the linear trend becomes less pronounced as the period advances"
